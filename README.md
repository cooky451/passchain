 * Dynamic search function allows you to find every entry in seconds.
 * Passchain saves a full history of all usernames / password with timestamps, in case you need an old password or press save accidentally.
 * You can export out of and merge into a database text-based, in case you want to make manual changes.
 * Passchain detects device inactivity and hibernation/sleep and automatically erases the encryption key from memory.
 * The database is encrypted in-memory to reduce the attack surface and make general memory string searching useless.
 * Database files are encrypted with ChaCha20 and MAC'd with SHA-3-256. The encryption key is derived with 10002 iterations of SHA-3-256.
